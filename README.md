This is my first project, a cyberpunk style dashboard meant to create a static display with periodic updates. The intention was mainly to practice functions, work with APIs, and do a bit of frontend display
PLEASE USE VERSION 1.0 FOR WINDOWS FUNCTIONALITY, further versions will include a CPU temp readout that is only available on Linux and may break the code on windows (updating furhter versions for windows may happen eventually).
I suggest placing your API key in a system variable rather than hardcoding but for running locally hardcoding works as well.
Remember to change the area variable to your location for accurate weather forecasts.
My current plan for further versions includes more details in my current panels and customizable functions to change displayed info in the panels/add more panels to display.
